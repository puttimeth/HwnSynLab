UTLZ-1#1 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
F7 Muxes over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more F7 Muxes cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 17475 of such cell types but only 16300 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device.)ROOT
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-1#2 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
F8 Muxes over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more F8 Muxes cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 8708 of such cell types but only 8150 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device.)ROOT
